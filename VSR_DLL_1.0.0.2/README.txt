
# This Is Almost Certainly Not the Version of the DLL That You Looking for #

# For instructions how to generate the vsr.dll required by HexitecVSR.exe, see VSR_DLL_1.0.0.1\README.txt
# NOTE: While both Debug and Release can successfully be built, they have not been tested against the HexitecVSR executable(!)

# Also note, although this library is versioned 1.0.0.2, it is actually compiled against a outdated version of the Pleora drivers.

# Instructions prepared by Christian Angelsen on 2022/03/03
# DLL generation tested using:

Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2017
Windows SDK Version 10.0.17763.0
